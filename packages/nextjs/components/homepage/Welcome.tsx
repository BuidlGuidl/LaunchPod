      <p>
        We&apos;re running an experiment to fund focused, high-leverage open-source work by providing streams to
        builders rewarding them for their ongoing contributions to BuidlGuidl and the Ethereum Ecosystem. Our emphasis
        is on quality over quantity, striving for well-crafted products. Our approach embraces iteration, refining our
        builds while fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
